Introduction
------------

MongoChem is an open-source, cross-platform framework for managing large
collections of chemical data. It uses MongoDB to store and retrieve data, and
can be used in groups to share and search across work being done in a group.
Some highlights:

MongoChem is being developed as part of the [Open Chemistry][OpenChemistry]
project at [Kitware][Kitware], along with companion tools and libraries to
support the work.
